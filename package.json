We are taking the url and concatenating in parameters that the user searches for. In this case gifs, when we retrieve the information we then <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise\">promises</a> to run the function generating the images and all the associated classes and attributes. From here we append them to the page. Each time the page loads we are making the array of buttons, and each time the user clicks on the add image button we add the users input to the array and iterate through again and the buttons are added. Additionally when the images are all loaded we are pulling there still image URL. We set a click listener on their class and pull the data attribute value and reassign the attribute to one that contains the moving image. If the image is already playing the user can then click on it again to reassign the data attribute to the still url.",
